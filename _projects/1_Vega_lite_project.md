# Homehwork8ï¼š Charts of University Agency Owned Buildings

{% include assignment.html %}

The upper visualization is a bar chart that illustrates the count of buildings categorized by their usage description, when the cursor hover over on a bar, it will show each cartgory's value.This chart is able to show the usage types among university buildings and let users identify which usage types are most common.

I used bars as the mark of the chart, which is effective for showing the quantity and for comparison. The x-axis is nominal, representing agency names, and the y-axis is quantitative, representing the count of buildings. I also tilted the x-axis to a 90-degree angle to ensure they were not overlapping. I just leave the chart as the default color. There is no need to use multiple colors since they are the same quantity.

It allows users to quickly identify which agencies have the largest and smallest numbers of buildings.

I used bars as the mark of the chart, which is effective for showing the quantity and for comparison. The x-axis is nominal, representing agency names, and the y-axis is quantitative, representing the count of buildings. Because there are significant numerical differences in the number of buildings for different agencies, I have set the scale of the y-axis to exponential.I also tilted the x-axis to a 90-degree angle to ensure they were not overlapping. I set different agency to different color, make them easier to differentiate.
